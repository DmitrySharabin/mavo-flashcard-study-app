Flashcards move depending on the ranking after self-grading:

- in case you choose **Bad** answer, rank becomes equal to 0, and the flashcard moves to the beginning
- in case you choose **Good** Answer, rank increases by 1, and the flashcard doesn't move
- in case you choose **Great** Answer, rank increases by 2, and the flashcard moves to the end
